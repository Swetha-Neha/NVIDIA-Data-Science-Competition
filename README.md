# NVIDIA-Data-Science-Competition
ODSC Manor’s Haunted Hackathon: Spooktacular NVIDIA Data Science Competition



This Halloween, we’re challenging brave data scientists to confront a frightfully large dataset, filled with creepy creatures, eerie enigmas, and spine-chilling stats. Are you up for this hair-raising challenge?
Hidden within our mysterious dataset are the details of 12 million monsters from around the world. Each ghastly ghoul and sinister spirit is described by 106 monstrous anonymous features — some categorical, some numerical, all horrifyingly fascinating. From fang length and howls-per-minute to favorite haunt and cape swirl radius, each feature holds clues that could lead you to crack this Halloween mystery.

The Challenge
The ultimate question remains: Who is the Scariest Monster of them all? 🏆💀 Your task is a regression to predict the target variable, “y” — the number of votes each monster received in the global terror poll. Note: You are required to use either pandas or Polars DataFrames in your solution.
Will the werewolf reign supreme, or is there an underdog (underwolf?) lurking in the shadows?
